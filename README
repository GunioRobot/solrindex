This is SolrIndex, an interface for Solr written at Curbed.com. It's rough and un(unit)tested, but has been in production for a while and seems to work pretty well. Documentation and cleanups are forthcoming. Definitely don't expect it to work out of the box.

Take it and turn it into something useful for you (or use parts of it as a reference implementation).

Assumes you have Will Paginate and Erik Hatcher's solr library installed.

Example of how to declare a model's schema for searching:

class Post
  # title, body, rating and published_at are fields in the database.

  has_many :authors

  index_fields(
    :string       => [:title, :slug],
    :string_array => [:authors],
    :text         => [:description],
    :range_float  => [:rating],
    :date         => [:published_at]
  )

  index_conditions(
    :include    => [:authors],
    :conditions => [ '? >= published_at', Date.today, true ],
    :order      => "published_at DESC"
  )
  
  
  def authors_for_index
    authors.map(&:name)
  end
  
  def slug
    title.downcase.gsub(/\s/, '_').gsub(/[^\w]/,'')
  end
  
end



... or thereabouts.
